# Sample Implementation

This folder contains some sample cpp programs that implement the library and cover the different test cases of all the three LRU,LIFO and FIFO cache. 


To run the program,like "sample_lru_cache.cpp", follow the following steps:-

1. g++ -o sample sample_lru_cache.cpp -I../include

NOTE:- makesure the include folder is available to use while compiling the cpp folder as that is where the headers reside

2. ./sample
